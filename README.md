# CouchoDetecto
Code and files for Pet Couch Detector Project: RPi and AI

1.  Download this folder to your Pi and unzip it.
2.  Copy the 3 files directly into the tensorflow1/models/research/object_detection directory.  They should be in that directory with no other enclosing folder.  This is important!!!

-Use the cat script for cats
-Use the dog script if you have a problem with a dog sitting on your couch
-The pet-annoy sound is a 4000hz tone that is used in lots of pet deterrent devices.

I use Thonny to load the .py files and press play.
